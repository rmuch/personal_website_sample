Personal Website
================

Introduction
------------

This is a simple example of a web application written in Go. It serves as the
basis of my personal website, and you can use it as a template to get started
with serving requests and rendering templates in the Go programming language.

Getting Started
---------------

After you clone the repository, don't forget to fetch the submodule(s) by
`cd`ing into their respective directories and running the commands
`git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.

You need to make a log directory (`mkdir logs`) before you get started
building and running the application with `./all.bash` and `run.bash`
respectively.
